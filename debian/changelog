v86d (0.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #507325)
  * debian/rules:
    + Install misc/initramfs to /u/s/v86d (as requested by Dave Witbrodt).
    + Use dh_clean instead of rm -f in the clean target.
    + Use $(QUILT_STAMPFN) instead of patch, so configure isn't run twice.
    + Add $(CURDIR) to the direct install calls.
  * debian/patches:
    + Refresh 01_use-external-libx86.patch as upstream has changed the
      Makefile a bit.
    + Add 02_fix-parsing-of-OEM-descriptions.patch and
      03_map-BIOS-with-PROT_WRITE.patch from upstream git.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    + Note that uvesafb is in Debian's default kernels now.
    + Correctly document initrd usage.
    + uvesafb from recent kernels wants mode_option instead of mode.
  * debian/control:
    + Update my e-mail address.
    + Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1.
